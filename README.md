# LinkedIn outreach assistant

This app scrapes two LinkedIn profiles to learn the sender's voice and the what is top of mind for the target. It then generates personalized LinkedIn connection notes and cold emails, written in the sender's voice. The app runs locally using the Ollama model of your preference. No cloud API calls, nothing leaves your computer.

---

## What it does

1. Scrapes the sender's and recipient's LinkedIn profiles (bio, experience, activity feed)
2. Detects shared employers, groups, and analyzes the recipient's recent posts to deduce what's top of mind for them and inform outreach.
3. Passes the data to your preferred local LLM model (via Ollama)
4. Outputs a structured analysis: tone profile, destination insights, overlap, connection points, outreach strategy
5. Generates 5 LinkedIn connection notes (≤300 chars) and 5 cold email drafts based on the sender's voice and what is top of mind for the recepient. These drafts act as a starting point for customized outreach.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | Runtime |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | Local LLM inference |
| A LinkedIn account | Scraping requires an active session |
| Chrome / Chromium | Playwright uses it for scraping |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/li-insights.git
cd li-insights
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Install and start Ollama

Download Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), then pull a model:

Any model available in Ollama will work. Larger models (8B+) produce noticeably better output and hallucinate less.

### 5. Log in to LinkedIn

Start the app:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and click **Connect LinkedIn** in the top-right corner. Log in through the browser window that opens. Your session is saved locally to `session.json` and reused for all future scrapes.

---

## Running the app

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

1. Paste the sender's LinkedIn profile URL (pre-filled automatically if you're logged in)
2. Paste the recipient's LinkedIn profile URL
3. Select a model from the dropdown
4. Click **Analyze**

Results stream in live and are organized into cards: tone analysis, destination insights, overlap, connection points, outreach strategy, LinkedIn drafts, and email drafts.

## Limitations

- **LinkedIn rate limiting** — LinkedIn may temporarily block scraping if you run too many analyses in quick succession. Space out your requests.
- **Model quality** — Small models (3B–4B) will occasionally hallucinate details. Using a 7B+ model significantly reduces this. The prompt instructs the model to only use facts from the scraped data, but small models don't always comply.
- **LinkedIn DOM changes** — LinkedIn updates its frontend regularly. If scraping breaks (missing employers, empty activity), the CSS selectors in `scraper.py` may need updating.
- **Activity feed depth** — Only the most recent ~10 posts are scraped per profile. Older activity is not included.
- **No public profiles** — Scraping requires an active LinkedIn login. Profiles that block logged-out viewers may return partial data.
- **Local only** — The app is designed to run on localhost. It is not hardened for public deployment (no auth, no rate limiting on the API).
- **macOS/Linux tested** — Windows support is not guaranteed; Playwright and path handling may need adjustments.
